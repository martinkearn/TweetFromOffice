# Tweet From Office
A simple Office add-in that enables the posting of Tweets from within Office.

This is not production code, simply a sample of how you can send a tweet via office.

This uses a standard Office Add-in app for interaction with Office. It also uses ASP.net MVC application and the [LinqToTwitter](https://github.com/JoeMayo/LinqToTwitter) library for Twitter API calls.
